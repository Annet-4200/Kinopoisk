# REACT EXPRESS Boilerplate

This is a sophisticated boilerplate that uses React on front-end and Node.js (Express) on back-end.

This boilerplate is empowered by the following technologies:
• Redux  
• Redux-saga  
• Realm
• Material-UI    

It's a usable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app, using todo-s to illustrate that.

Follow the steps below to get started using this boilerplate for your project!

### Prerequisites
• Node - version >= 7  
• npm - version >= 4
